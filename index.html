    <p>
        Bio/about section
        I am a Junior at Oregon State University Cascades, and I am in pursuit of an outdoor products degree. Through my time at OSU, I have developed an array of skills ranging from operations and supply chain management, marketing, sales, and product design all with a focus in the outdoor products industry. Professionally, I have proven to be a reliable employee having experience across several professional workplace environments. I am looking to apply specific skills in order to provide value to a company developing cutting edge products in the outdoor industry.
